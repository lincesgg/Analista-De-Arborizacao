I know you're with a knife, but as I'm not sure about what caused it the best solutions it's just to pretend as it doesn't exist and wait some dopamine wave to it dissapear. Time will never come you back, just remember this.

Wtf, what's happening now. I'm not sure. I can say for sure that I'm tense, but it1d kinda hard to define what we're talking about ... - hat's pretty fun. I really don't now what to do, in funny way, it has been like 2 to 3 consecutively that I wanna cry without a clear reason, I just wanna lay down and die, but i don't know the fucking reason, so I can't do nothing, but it's same time this felling and situation it's pretty discomfortable, and I just'd to solve it. 

I don't have nothing to say right now, just wanna to still writing and writing as a way to this anxiety go out, but i now it won't make any effects, I just wanna die - Why you keep repeating like this, i now I don't want the death to my soul, but at same time I just felling kinda a knife, sword or katana into to my heart don't feel like good, but I have no choice.

What could I do?

I just would like to cry, but I had some trouble trying to do it ...
